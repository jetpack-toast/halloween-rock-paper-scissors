# Halloween Rock Paper Scissors
A simple Halloween themed game of rock paper scissors developed in Kotlin for Android.

# A Just-For-Fun Project
I originally created this Halloween rock paper scissors game for an Android training I gave for CHG Healthcare this year (2020).

# A Sigh of Relief
This game is available on the Google Play store. It is completely FREE with NO ads and NO in-app purchases. Hopefully this comes as somewhat of a relief in a world where even the simplest of apps are smothered in ads or implement tactics to get you to pay for something.
